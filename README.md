## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
-   [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) >=16.6.0 and npm
-   A full access Minecraft Java Edition account

### Setup

1. ⭐ Star this repository!
2. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) via one of their [installation methods](https://pnpm.io/installation), or the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g pnpm
```

3. Clone the repository into a directory of your choice.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tapir132/bridge.git
```

4. Enter the new directory and install packages.

```bash
$ cd bridge
$ pnpm install
```

5. Make a new Discord bot account on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and retrieve the bot token.

6. Under the `Bot` tab, grant the bot the `Message Content` Intent.

7. Generate an invite URL by going to the OAuth2 tab and clicking on the URL Generator. Add the `bot` and `application.commands` scopes, before opening the link to invite the bot to your server.

8. Setup the project config files.

```bash
$ pnpm run setup-files
```

9. Fill out the `.env` file with your credentials.

10. Promote the Minecraft account the bot uses to Officer in-game in order for it to view the Officer chat and run privileged commands.

11. Build and run the bot.

```bash
$ pnpm run build
$ pnpm start
```

### Rank Emojis (NOT RECOMMENDED)

Optionally, you may activate the use of rank emojis in discord messages by following these steps:

1. Run the `/emojis upload` command in a discord server of your choice.

    > **Note**
    > It is recommended to run this command in an alternate server, as it uses a significant number of emoji slots. In this case, the user of id `BOT_OWNER_ID` is the only person with permission to run this command.

2. Set the value of `USE_RANK_EMOJIS` in the `.env` file to `true`, or `false` to disable this feature.

If at any time you wish to delete the emojis created by the bot, run the `/emojis remove` command.

### Process Management

If you are self-hosting or your process manager does not automatically restart the bot in the event of a crash, you may use [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/), a process manager for Node.js applications.

1. Install PM2.

```bash
$ pnpm add pm2
```

2. Use the `pm2` script instead of the `start` script to launch the bot.

```bash
$ pnpm run pm2
```

Please refer to the [PM2 Documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/) for more configuration options and information about PM2.
